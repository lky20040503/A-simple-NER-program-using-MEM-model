A  O
spokesman  O
for  O

Hardline  O

in  O

that  O
aims  O
to  O
ensure  O
"  O
Islamic  O

a  O
step  O

The  O
ambush  O
came  O
a  O
day  O
after  O
a  O

troops  O
said  O
the  O
army  O
has  O
almost  O
completely  O
eliminated  O
militants  O

The  O

became  O
a  O
refuge  O
for  O
many  O
al-Qaida  O

after  O
the  O
Taleban  O
government  O

He  O
was  O
placed  O
under  O
house  O
arrest  O
in  O
Islamabad  O

too  O
much  O
money  O

The  O

strongly  O
denies  O

When  O
the  O

that  O

the  O
need  O
for  O

apparent  O
during  O
the  O
2003  O
SARS  O

driving  O

shut  O
them  O
up  O
together  O
with  O
his  O

for  O
the  O
night  O

The  O
next  O
day  O
it  O
snowed  O
very  O
hard  O

so  O
that  O
he  O
could  O
not  O
take  O
the  O

was  O

keep  O
them  O
in  O
the  O
fold  O

gave  O
his  O
own  O
goats  O
just  O
sufficient  O
food  O
to  O
keep  O
them  O
alive  O

fed  O
the  O
strangers  O
more  O
abundantly  O
in  O
the  O
hope  O
of  O
enticing  O
them  O
to  O
stay  O
with  O
him  O

of  O
making  O
them  O
his  O
own  O

out  O

scampered  O
away  O

they  O
could  O
to  O
the  O

them  O

ingratitude  O

him  O

One  O

turning  O

it  O

they  O
find  O
the  O

distasteful  O

15  O

also  O
described  O
faith  O
as  O
a  O

the  O

when  O

start  O
coming  O
home  O
.  O
The  O
secretary  O
refused  O
to  O
offer  O
a  O
timetable  O
,  O
saying  O
any  O
withdrawal  O
depends  O
on  O
Iraqi  O
forces  O
being  O
able  O
to  O
fight  O
the  O
insurgents  O
independently  O

The  O

the  O
island  O
for  O
most  O
of  O
the  O
18th  O
century  O
,  O
but  O
it  O
finally  O
was  O
confirmed  O
as  O
a  O
British  O
possession  O
in  O
1783  O

The  O
island  O

converted  O
to  O

in  O
the  O
mid  O
19th  O
century  O
.  O
Much  O
of  O
this  O
island  O
was  O
devastated  O
and  O
two-thirds  O
of  O
the  O

fled  O
abroad  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
eruption  O
of  O

Georgia  O
's  O
economy  O

growth  O
of  O
more  O
than  O
10  O
%  O
in  O
2006  O

based  O
on  O
strong  O

.  O
However  O
,  O
GDP  O
growth  O
slowed  O
in  O
2008  O
following  O
the  O
August  O
2008  O
conflict  O
with  O
Russia  O
,  O
and  O
turned  O
negative  O

but  O
rebounded  O
in  O
2010  O

Georgia  O
's  O
main  O
economic  O
activities  O
include  O
the  O
cultivation  O
of  O
agricultural  O
products  O
such  O
as  O

growth  O
in  O
the  O
construction  O

sectors  O
,  O
but  O
reduced  O
availability  O
of  O
external  O
investment  O
and  O
the  O
slowing  O
regional  O
economy  O
are  O
emerging  O
risks  O
.  O
The  O
country  O
imports  O
nearly  O
all  O
its  O
needed  O
supplies  O
of  O
natural  O
gas  O
and  O
oil  O
products  O

has  O
sizeable  O
hydropower  O
capacity  O
,  O
a  O
growing  O
component  O
of  O
its  O
energy  O
supplies  O
.  O
Georgia  O
has  O
overcome  O
the  O
chronic  O
energy  O
shortages  O
and  O
gas  O
supply  O
interruptions  O
of  O
the  O
past  O
by  O
renovating  O
hydropower  O
plants  O
and  O
by  O
increasingly  O
relying  O
on  O
natural  O
gas  O
imports  O
from  O
Azerbaijan  O
instead  O
of  O
from  O

.  O
The  O
construction  O

the  O
Baku-T'bilisi-Erzerum  O
gas  O
pipeline  O
,  O
and  O
the  O
Kars-Akhalkalaki  O
Railroad  O
are  O
part  O
of  O
a  O
strategy  O
to  O
capitalize  O
on  O
Georgia  O
's  O
strategic  O
location  O
between  O
Europe  O
and  O
Asia  O
and  O
develop  O
its  O
role  O
as  O
a  O
transit  O
point  O
for  O
gas  O
,  O
oil  O
and  O
other  O
goods  O
.  O
Georgia  O
has  O
historically  O
suffered  O
from  O
a  O
chronic  O
failure  O
to  O
collect  O
tax  O
revenues  O
;  O
however  O
,  O
the  O
government  O
,  O
since  O
coming  O
to  O
power  O
in  O
2004  O
,  O
has  O
simplified  O
the  O
tax  O
code  O
,  O
improved  O
tax  O
administration  O
,  O
increased  O
tax  O
enforcement  O
,  O
and  O
cracked  O
down  O
on  O
petty  O
corruption  O
.  O
However  O
,  O
the  O
economic  O
downturn  O
of  O
2008  O
-  O
9  O
eroded  O
the  O
tax  O
base  O
and  O
led  O
to  O
a  O
decline  O
in  O
the  O
budget  O
surplus  O
and  O
an  O
increase  O
in  O
public  O
borrowing  O
needs  O
.  O
The  O
country  O
is  O
pinning  O
its  O
hopes  O
for  O
renewed  O
growth  O
on  O
a  O
determined  O
effort  O
to  O
continue  O
to  O
liberalize  O
the  O
economy  O
by  O
reducing  O
regulation  O
,  O
taxes  O
,  O
and  O
corruption  O
in  O
order  O
to  O
attract  O
foreign  O
investment  O
,  O

the  O
economy  O
faces  O
a  O
more  O
difficult  O
investment  O
climate  O
both  O
domestically  O
and  O
internationally  O
.  O
After  O
discarding  O
socialist  O
economic  O
policies  O
in  O
the  O
mid-1990s  O
,  O
Madagascar  O
followed  O
a  O
World  O
Bank-  O
and  O
IMF-led  O
policy  O
of  O
privatization  O
and  O
liberalization  O
that  O
has  O
been  O
undermined  O
since  O
the  O
start  O
of  O
the  O
political  O
crisis  O
.  O
This  O
strategy  O
placed  O
the  O
country  O
on  O
a  O
slow  O
and  O
steady  O
growth  O
path  O
from  O
an  O
extremely  O
low  O
level  O

for  O
more  O

one-fourth  O
of  O

and  O
employing  O
80  O

of  O
the  O
population  O
.  O
Exports  O
of  O

have  O
boomed  O
in  O

The  O
agreement  O
also  O
commits  O
France  O
to  O
conduct  O
a  O
referendum  O
between  O

ALL  O
the  O
Goods  O
were  O
once  O
driven  O
out  O
by  O
the  O
Ills  O
from  O
that  O
common  O
share  O
which  O
they  O
each  O
had  O
in  O
the  O
affairs  O
of  O
mankind  O
;  O
for  O
the  O
Ills  O
by  O
reason  O
of  O
their  O
numbers  O
had  O
prevailed  O
to  O
possess  O
the  O
earth  O
.  O
The  O
Goods  O
wafted  O
themselves  O
to  O
heaven  O
and  O
asked  O
for  O
a  O
righteous  O
vengeance  O
on  O
their  O
persecutors  O
.  O
They  O
entreated  O
Jupiter  O
that  O
they  O
might  O
no  O
longer  O
be  O
associated  O
with  O
the  O
Ills  O
,  O
as  O
they  O
had  O
nothing  O
in  O
common  O
and  O
could  O
not  O
live  O
together  O
,  O
but  O
were  O
engaged  O
in  O
unceasing  O
warfare  O
;  O
and  O
that  O
an  O
indissoluble  O
law  O
might  O
be  O
laid  O
down  O
for  O
their  O
future  O
protection  O
.  O
Jupiter  O
granted  O
their  O
request  O
and  O
decreed  O
that  O
henceforth  O
the  O
Ills  O
should  O
visit  O
the  O
earth  O
in  O
company  O
with  O
each  O
other  O
,  O
but  O
that  O
the  O
Goods  O
should  O
one  O
by  O
one  O
enter  O
the  O
habitations  O
of  O
men  O
.  O
Hence  O
it  O
arises  O
that  O
Ills  O
abound  O
,  O
for  O
they  O
come  O
not  O
one  O
by  O
one  O
,  O
but  O
in  O
troops  O
,  O
and  O
by  O
no  O
means  O
singly  O
:  O
while  O
the  O
Goods  O
proceed  O
from  O
Jupiter  O
,  O
and  O
are  O
given  O
,  O
not  O
alike  O
to  O
all  O
,  O
but  O
singly  O
,  O
and  O
separately  O
;  O

one  O
by  O
one  O

those  O
who  O
are  O
able  O

them  O

they  O

were  O
planning  O

carry  O
out  O
a  O

in  O
Jerusalem  O
on  O

Also  O
the  O
Israeli  O

hold  O
a  O

late  O
Wednesday  O
on  O

in  O
East  O
Jerusalem  O
to  O
make  O

Palestinian  O
officials  O
have  O
criticized  O
the  O
plan  O
.  O
The  O
terrorist  O
group  O
al-Qaida  O
in  O
Iraq  O
has  O
criticized  O
the  O
country  O
's  O
moderate  O
Sunni  O
Arabs  O
for  O
taking  O
part  O
in  O
last  O
month  O
's  O
parliamentary  O
elections  O
and  O
called  O
on  O
them  O
to  O
abandon  O
electoral  O
politics  O
.  O
The  O
remark  O
came  O
in  O
an  O
audio  O
tape  O
posted  O
on  O
an  O
Islamist  O
web  O
site  O
Sunday  O
.  O
The  O
speaker  O
sounded  O
like  O
Abu  PERSON
Musab  PERSON
al-Zarqawi  PERSON
,  O
but  O
the  O
authenticity  O
of  O
the  O
tape  O
could  O
not  O
be  O
verified  O
.  O
In  O
the  O
tape  O
,  O
he  O
denounced  O
the  O
Iraqi  O
Islamic  O
Party  O
for  O
endorsing  O
a  O
new  O
constitution  O
,  O
and  O
said  O
the  O
largest  O
Sunni  O
Arab  O
party  O
should  O
not  O
be  O
involved  O
in  O
reconciliation  O
because  O
it  O
will  O
lead  O
to  O
the  O
destruction  O
of  O
the  O
Sunni  O
community  O
.  O
Zarqawi  O
said  O
his  O
group  O
could  O
have  O
disrupted  O
the  O
December  O
15  O
balloting  O
,  O
but  O
did  O
not  O
want  O
to  O
harm  O
the  O
Sunni  O
people  O
.  O
He  O
also  O
criticized  O
Arab  O
countries  O
that  O
met  O
in  O
Cairo  O
in  O
November  O
to  O
seek  O
reconciliation  O
between  O
Iraq  O
's  O
political  O
factions  O
.  O
He  O
said  O
those  O
countries  O
were  O
out  O
to  O
destroy  O
Iraq  O
and  O
cooperate  O
with  O
America  O
.  O
Egyptian  O
authorities  O
have  O
tentatively  O
identified  O
the  O
remains  O
of  O
one  O
of  O
the  O
bombers  O
who  O
struck  O
a  O
Red  O
Sea  O
resort  O
on  O
Saturday  O
,  O
killing  O
scores  O
of  O
people  O
.  O
Security  O
sources  O
say  O
they  O
believe  O
a  O
known  O
Sinai  O
militant  O
,  O
Youssef  O
Badran  O
,  O
was  O
at  O
the  O
wheel  O
of  O
a  O
vehicle  O
that  O
exploded  O
in  O
front  O
of  O
a  O
hotel  O
.  O
Authorities  O
were  O
performing  O
DNA  O
tests  O
Tuesday  O
to  O
confirm  O
the  O
identity  O
.  O
Egyptian  O
sources  O
say  O
police  O
have  O
been  O
looking  O
for  O
links  O
between  O
Saturday  O
's  O
attacks  O
and  O
two  O
Sinai  O
bombings  O
last  O
year  O
that  O
killed  O
34  O
people  O
.  O
The  O
possible  O
links  O
surfaced  O
after  O
two  O
militant  O
groups  O
claiming  O
credit  O
for  O
Saturday  O
's  O
attack  O
said  O
they  O
also  O
carried  O
out  O
bombings  O
last  O
October  O
near  O
a  O
resort  O
in  O
Taba  O
.  O
Meanwhile  O
,  O
the  O
Egyptian  O
Health  O
Ministry  O
says  O
64  O
people  O
died  O
in  O
the  O
blasts  O
,  O
while  O
local  O
doctors  O
say  O
they  O
account  O
for  O
88  O
fatalities  O
.  O
Several  O
reports  O
quote  O
hospitals  O
as  O
saying  O
the  O
ministry  O
count  O
excludes  O
some  O
sets  O
of  O
body  O
parts  O
.  O
Iraq  O
's  O
foreign  O
minister  O
says  O
Syria  O
is  O
refusing  O
to  O
stop  O
insurgents  O
and  O
foreign  O
fighters  O
from  O
entering  O
Iraq  O
.  O
Hoshyar  O
Zebari  O
told  O
the  O
Associated  O
Press  O
Thursday  O
Syria  O
and  O
other  O
authoritarian  O
governments  O
in  O
the  O
region  O
are  O
frightened  O
of  O
Iraq  O
's  O
efforts  O
to  O
build  O
a  O
democratic  O
nation  O
in  O
the  O
heart  O
of  O
the  O
Middle  O
East  O
and  O
want  O
to  O
see  O
it  O
fail  O
.  O
The  O
Iraqi  O
foreign  O
minister  O
said  O
these  O
governments  O
are  O
not  O
helping  O
stem  O
the  O
flow  O
of  O
foreign  O
fighters  O
and  O
weapons  O
into  O
Iraq  O
,  O
despite  O
pledges  O
to  O
do  O
so  O
.  O
Syria  O
's  O
U.N.  O
Ambassador  O
Fayssal  O
Mekdad  O
insisted  O
Wednesday  O
that  O
his  O
country  O
has  O
been  O
cooperating  O
with  O
Iraq  O
by  O
deploying  O
10,000  O
troops  O
on  O
the  O
border  O
,  O
erecting  O
barriers  O
and  O
arresting  O
hundreds  O
of  O
potential  O
infiltrators  O
.  O
Earlier  O
this  O
month  O
,  O
President  O
Bush  O
said  O
Syria  O
faces  O
growing  O
international  O
isolation  O
because  O
of  O
what  O
he  O
calls  O
its  O
failure  O
to  O
stop  O
fighters  O
from  O
crossing  O
its  O
border  O
into  O
Iraq  O
.  O
Burma  O
's  O
military  O
government  O
has  O
blamed  O
ethnic  O
Karen  O
rebels  O
for  O
a  O
land  O
mine  O
explosion  O
that  O
killed  O
two  O
people  O
and  O
wounded  O
11  O
others  O
in  O
the  O
country  O
's  O
east  O
.  O
Burmese  O
state  O
media  O
said  O
a  O
passenger  O
bus  O
hit  O
the  O
explosive  O
last  O
Sunday  O
as  O
it  O
was  O
traveling  O
in  O
Karen  O
State  O
about  O
200  O
kilometers  O
from  O
Rangoon  O
.  O
The  O
reports  O
said  O
the  O
junta  O
blamed  O
the  O
Karen  O
National  O
Union  O
for  O
the  O
blast  O
.  O
It  O
was  O
not  O
immediately  O
clear  O
why  O
the  O
incident  O
was  O
reported  O
only  O
Saturday  O
-  O
nearly  O
a  O
week  O
later  O
.  O
The  O
military  O
has  O
accused  O
the  O
Karen  O
National  O
Union  O
of  O
responsibility  O
for  O
a  O
series  O
of  O
bombings  O
in  O
recent  O
months  O
,  O
including  O
a  O
December  O
blast  O
in  O
Karen  O
state  O
that  O
killed  O
seven  O
people  O
.  O
The  O
Karen  O
National  O
Union  O
has  O
been  O
fighting  O
for  O
greater  O
autonomy  O
for  O
ethnic  O
Karen  O
people  O
in  O
Burma  O
for  O
more  O
than  O
60  O
years  O
.  O
Traditional  O
fishermen  O
in  O
poor  O
countries  O
around  O
the  O
world  O
face  O
tough  O
competition  O
from  O
international  O
industrial  O
fishing  O
operations  O
.  O
In  O
the  O
fishing-rich  O
West  O
African  O
nation  O
of  O
Guinea  O
,  O
there  O
are  O
laws  O
meant  O
to  O
preserve  O
some  O
waters  O
for  O
the  O
local  O
fishermen  O
.  O
But  O
a  O
lack  O
of  O
money  O
means  O
these  O
laws  O
often  O
are  O
not  O
enforced  O
.  O
Kari  O
Barber  O
reports  O
from  O
Conakry  O
that  O
many  O
traditional  O
fishermen  O
feel  O
they  O
are  O
being  O
squeezed  O
out  O
of  O
their  O
livelihoods  O
.  O
President  O
Bush  O
will  O
pay  O
tribute  O
at  O

A  O
key  O
U.S.  O
congressional  O

committee  O
voted  O
31  O

28  O
late  O
Friday  O
to  O
back  O
a  O
measure  O

at  O
extending  O
health  O

to  O
Americans  O
not  O
now  O
covered  O
.  O
Congress  O
is  O
about  O

A  O
major  O

will  O
stop  O
the  O
insurance  O
industry  O
from  O
coming  O
between  O
doctors  O
and  O
patients  O
.  O
But  O
minority  O
Republicans  O
say  O
the  O
proposal  O
costs  O
too  O
much  O
and  O
is  O
the  O
first  O
step  O
toward  O
a  O
government  O
takeover  O
of  O
health  O
care  O
.  O
Bangladeshi  O

better  O

Rogers  PERSON
also  O
says  O
the  O
actions  O
documented  O

Grenada  O
has  O
rebounded  O
from  O
the  O
devastating  O
effects  O
of  O
the  O
hurricanes  O
but  O
is  O
now  O
saddled  O
with  O
the  O
debt  O
burden  O
from  O
the  O
rebuilding  O
process  O
.  O
Public  O
debt-to-GDP  O
is  O
nearly  O
110  O
%  O
,  O
leaving  O
the  O
THOMAS  O

limited  O
room  O
to  O
engage  O

Strong  O
performances  O
in  O
construction  O
and  O
manufacturing  O
,  O
together  O
with  O
the  O
development  O
of  O
tourism  O
and  O
an  O
offshore  O
financial  O
industry  O
,  O
have  O
also  O
contributed  O
to  O
growth  O
in  O
national  O
output  O
;  O
however  O
,  O
economic  O
growth  O
was  O
stagnant  O
in  O
2010  O
after  O
a  O
sizeable  O
contraction  O
in  O
2009  O
,  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
global  O
economic  O
slowdown  O
's  O
effects  O
on  O
tourism  O
and  O
remittances  O
.  O
One  O
day  O
a  O
countryman  O
going  O
to  O
the  O
nest  O
of  O
his  O
Goose  O
found  O
there  O
an  O
egg  O
all  O
yellow  O
and  O
glittering  O
.  O
When  O
he  O
took  O
it  O
up  O
it  O
was  O
as  O
heavy  O
as  O
lead  O
and  O
he  O
was  O
going  O
to  O
throw  O
it  O
away  O
,  O
because  O
he  O
thought  O
a  O
trick  O
had  O
been  O
played  O
upon  O
him  O
.  O
But  O
he  O
took  O
it  O
home  O
on  O
second  O
thoughts  O
,  O
and  O
soon  O
found  O
to  O
his  O
delight  O
that  O
it  O
was  O
an  O
egg  O
of  O
pure  O
gold  O
.  O
Every  O
morning  O
the  O
same  O
thing  O
occurred  O
,  O
and  O
he  O
soon  O
became  O
rich  O
by  O
selling  O
his  O
eggs  O
.  O
As  O
he  O
grew  O
rich  O
he  O
grew  O
greedy  O
;  O
and  O
thinking  O
to  O
get  O
at  O
once  O
all  O
the  O
gold  O
the  O
Goose  O
could  O
give  O
,  O
he  O
killed  O
it  O
and  O
opened  O
it  O
only  O
to  O
find  O
nothing  O
.  O
Greed  O
oft  O
o'er  O
reaches  O
itself  O
.  O
A  O
Doe  O
had  O
had  O
the  O
misfortune  O
to  O
lose  O
one  O
of  O
her  O
eyes  O
,  O
and  O
could  O
not  O
see  O
any  O
one  O
approaching  O
her  O
on  O
that  O
side  O
.  O
So  O
to  O
avoid  O
any  O
danger  O
she  O
always  O
used  O
to  O
feed  O
on  O
a  O
high  O
cliff  O
near  O
the  O
sea  O
,  O
with  O
her  O
sound  O
eye  O
looking  O
towards  O
the  O
land  O
.  O
By  O
this  O
means  O
she  O
could  O
see  O
whenever  O
the  O
hunters  O
approached  O
her  O
on  O
land  O
,  O
and  O
often  O
escaped  O
by  O
this  O
means  O
.  O
But  O
the  O
hunters  O
found  O
out  O
that  O
she  O
was  O
blind  O
of  O
one  O
eye  O
,  O
and  O
hiring  O
a  O
boat  O
rowed  O
under  O
the  O
cliff  O
where  O
she  O
used  O
to  O
feed  O
and  O
shot  O
her  O
from  O
the  O
sea  O
.  O
"  O
Ah  O
,  O
"  O
cried  O
she  O
with  O
her  O
dying  O
voice  O
,  O
"  O
You  O
can  O
not  O
escape  O
your  O
fate  O
.  O

A  O
WOLF  O
followed  O
a  O
flock  O
of  O
sheep  O
for  O
a  O
long  O
time  O
and  O
did  O
not  O
attempt  O
to  O
injure  O
one  O
of  O
them  O
.  O
The  O
Shepherd  O
at  O
first  O
stood  O
on  O
his  O
guard  O
against  O
him  O
,  O
as  O
against  O
an  O
enemy  O
,  O
and  O
kept  O
a  O
strict  O
watch  O
over  O
his  O
movements  O
.  O
But  O
when  O
the  O
Wolf  PERSON
,  O
day  O
after  O
day  O
,  O
kept  O
in  O
the  O
company  O
of  O
the  O
sheep  O
and  O
did  O
not  O
make  O
the  O
slightest  O
effort  O
to  O
seize  O
them  O
,  O
the  O
Shepherd  O
began  O
to  O
look  O
upon  O
him  O
as  O
a  O
guardian  O
of  O
his  O
flock  O
rather  O
than  O
as  O
a  O
plotter  O
of  O
evil  O
against  O
it  O
;  O
and  O
when  O
occasion  O
called  O
him  O
one  O
day  O
into  O
the  O
city  O
,  O
he  O
left  O
the  O
sheep  O
entirely  O
in  O
his  O
charge  O
.  O
The  O
Wolf  PERSON
,  O
now  O
that  O
he  O
had  O
the  O
opportunity  O
,  O
fell  O
upon  O
the  O
sheep  O
,  O
and  O
destroyed  O
the  O
greater  O
part  O
of  O
the  O
flock  O
.  O
When  O
the  O
Shepherd  O
returned  O
to  O
find  O
his  O
flock  O
destroyed  O
,  O
he  O
exclaimed  O
:  O
"  O
I  O
have  O
been  O
rightly  O
served  O
;  O
why  O
did  O
I  O
trust  O
my  O

of  O
seeking  O
to  O
spark  O
a  O
civil  O
war  O

asserted  O

the  O

are  O
concerned  O
that  O

lead  O

a  O
civil  O
war  O
like  O
the  O
one  O
that  O
raged  O
from  O
1975  O

Secretary-General  O
Kofi  O

.  O
Mr.  O
Annan  O
told  O

Mr.  O

Other  O
options  O
include  O
moving  O

Mr.  O

an  O
ideal  O
way  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
stalemate  O

The  O

peaked  O
between  O
the  O
15th  O

17th  O
centuries  O

control  O
extended  O
over  O
coastal  O
areas  O

northwest  O
Borneo  O

the  O
southern  O
Philippines  O

Brunei  O
subsequently  O
entered  O
a  O
period  O

on  O

for  O
the  O
whole  O

the  O
20th  O

,  O
Sweden  O
has  O
achieved  O
an  O

,  O
Swedish  O

Until  O
2008  O
,  O
Sweden  O
was  O
in  O
the  O

of  O
a  O
sustained  O
economic  O
upswing  O
,  O
boosted  O
by  O
increased  O
domestic  O
demand  O
and  O
strong  O
exports  O

This  O
and  O
robust  O
finances  O
offered  O
the  O
center-right  O

considerable  O
scope  O
to  O
implement  O
its  O

at  O
increasing  O

Despite  O
strong  O
finances  O
and  O
underlying  O
fundamentals  O
,  O
the  O
Swedish  O
economy  O
slid  O
into  O
recession  O
in  O
the  O
third  O
quarter  O
of  O
2008  O
and  O
growth  O
continued  O
downward  O
in  O
2009  O
as  O
deteriorating  O
global  O
conditions  O
reduced  O
export  O
demand  O
and  O
consumption  O
.  O
Strong  O
exports  O
of  O
commodities  O
and  O
a  O
return  O
to  O
profitability  O
by  O
Sweden  O
's  O
banking  O
sector  O
drove  O
the  O
strong  O
rebound  O
in  O
2010  O

El  O

achieved  O
independence  O
from  O
Spain  O
in  O
1821  O
and  O
from  O
the  O
Central  O
American  O
Federation  O
in  O
1839  O
.  O
A  O
12-year  O
civil  O
war  O
,  O
which  O
cost  O
about  O
75,000  O
lives  O
,  O
was  O
brought  O
to  O
a  O
close  O
in  O
1992  O
when  O
the  O
government  O
and  O
leftist  O
rebels  O
signed  O
a  O
treaty  O
that  O
provided  O
for  O
military  O
and  O
political  O
reforms  O
.  O
A  O
HARE  O
one  O
day  O
ridiculed  O
the  O
short  O
feet  O
and  O
slow  O
pace  O
of  O
the  O
Tortoise  O
,  O
who  O
replied  O
,  O
laughing  O
:  O
"  O
Though  O
you  O
be  O
swift  O
as  O
the  O
wind  O
,  O
I  O
will  O
beat  O
you  O
in  O
a  O
race  O
.  O
"  O
The  O
Hare  O
,  O
believing  O
her  O
assertion  O
to  O
be  O
simply  O
impossible  O
,  O
assented  O
to  O
the  O
proposal  O
;  O
and  O
they  O
agreed  O
that  O
the  O
Fox  PERSON
should  O
choose  O
the  O
course  O
and  O
fix  O
the  O
goal  O
.  O
On  O
the  O
day  O
appointed  O
for  O
the  O
race  O
the  O
two  O
started  O
together  O
.  O
The  O
Tortoise  O
never  O
for  O
a  O
moment  O
stopped  O
,  O
but  O
went  O
on  O
with  O
a  O
slow  O
but  O
steady  O
pace  O
straight  O
to  O
the  O
end  O
of  O
the  O
course  O
.  O
The  O
Hare  O
,  O
lying  O
down  O
by  O
the  O
wayside  O
,  O
fell  O
fast  O
asleep  O
.  O
At  O
last  O
waking  O
up  O
,  O
and  O
moving  O
as  O
fast  O
as  O
he  O
could  O
,  O
he  O
saw  O
the  O
Tortoise  O
had  O
reached  O
the  O
goal  O
,  O
and  O
was  O
comfortably  O
dozing  O
after  O
her  O
fatigue  O
.  O
Slow  O
but  O
steady  O
wins  O
the  O
race  O
.  O
AN  O
OWL  O
,  O
in  O
her  O
wisdom  O
,  O
counseled  O
the  O
Birds  O
that  O
when  O
the  O
acorn  O
first  O
began  O
to  O
sprout  O
,  O
to  O
pull  O
it  O
all  O
up  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
ground  O
and  O
not  O
allow  O
it  O
to  O
grow  O
.  O
She  O
said  O
acorns  O
would  O
produce  O
mistletoe  O
,  O
from  O
which  O
an  O
irremediable  O
poison  O
,  O
the  O
bird-lime  O
,  O
would  O
be  O
extracted  O
and  O
by  O
which  O
they  O
would  O
be  O
captured  O
.  O
The  O
Owl  O
next  O
advised  O
them  O
to  O
pluck  O
up  O
the  O
seed  O
of  O
the  O
flax  O
,  O
which  O
men  O
had  O
sown  O
,  O
as  O
it  O
was  O
a  O
plant  O
which  O
boded  O
no  O
good  O
to  O
them  O
.  O
And  O
,  O
lastly  O
,  O
the  O
Owl  O
,  O
seeing  O
an  O
archer  O
approach  O
,  O
predicted  O
that  O
this  O
man  O
,  O
being  O
on  O
foot  O
,  O
would  O
contrive  O
darts  O
armed  O
with  O
feathers  O
which  O
would  O
fly  O
faster  O
than  O
the  O
wings  O
of  O
the  O
Birds  O
themselves  O
.  O
The  O
Birds  O
gave  O
no  O
credence  O
to  O
these  O
warning  O
words  O
,  O
but  O
considered  O
the  O
Owl  O
to  O
be  O
beside  O
herself  O
and  O
said  O
that  O
she  O
was  O
mad  O
.  O
But  O
afterwards  O
,  O
finding  O
her  O
words  O
were  O
TRUE  O
,  O
they  O
wondered  O
at  O
her  O
knowledge  O
and  O
deemed  O
her  O
to  O
be  O
the  O
wisest  O
of  O
birds  O
.  O
Hence  O
it  O
is  O
that  O
when  O
she  O
appears  O
they  O
look  O
to  O
her  O
as  O
knowing  O
all  O
things  O
,  O
while  O
she  O
no  O
longer  O
gives  O
them  O
advice  O
,  O
but  O
in  O
solitude  O
laments  O
their  O
past  O
folly  O
.  O
Six  O
Afghan  O
police  O
officers  O
and  O
two  O
U.S.  O

said  O
ETA  O
was  O
weaker  O

Spanish  O
democracy  O
was  O
stronger  O
because  O
of  O
the  O
arrest  O
.  O
Analysts  O
said  O
it  O
further  O
undermines  O
ETA  O

hard-line  O

Some  O
experts  O
believe  O
the  O
arrests  O
may  O
give  O
voice  O
to  O
moderates  O

the  O

group  O
who  O
back  O
dialogue  O
rather  O

The  O
GOLDING  O
administration  O
faces  O
the  O
difficult  O
prospect  O
of  O
having  O
to  O
achieve  O
fiscal  O
discipline  O

attacking  O
a  O
serious  O

that  O
is  O
hampering  O
economic  O
growth  O

High  O

exacerbates  O
the  O

problem  O
,  O
including  O
gang  O

that  O
is  O

Since  O
the  O
1960s  O
,  O
South  O
Korea  O
has  O
achieved  O
an  O
incredible  O
record  O
of  O
growth  O
and  O
global  O
integration  O
to  O
become  O
a  O
high-tech  O
industrialized  O
economy  O
.  O
Four  O
decades  O
ago  O
,  O
GDP  O
per  O

was  O
comparable  O
with  O
levels  O
in  O
the  O
poorer  O
countries  O
of  O
Africa  O
and  O
Asia  O
.  O
In  O
2004  O
,  O
South  O
Korea  O
joined  O
the  O
trillion  O

club  O
of  O
world  O
economies  O
,  O
and  O
currently  O
is  O
among  O
the  O

20  O

.  O
Initially  O
,  O
a  O
system  O
of  O
close  O
government  O
and  O
business  O
ties  O
,  O
including  O
directed  O
credit  O
and  O
import  O
restrictions  O
,  O
made  O
this  O
success  O
possible  O
.  O
The  O
government  O
promoted  O
the  O
import  O
of  O
raw  O
materials  O
and  O
technology  O
at  O
the  O
expense  O
of  O
consumer  O
goods  O
,  O
and  O
encouraged  O
savings  O
and  O

over  O
consumption  O
.  O
The  O
Asian  O
financial  O
crisis  O
of  O
1997  O
-  O
98  O
exposed  O
longstanding  O
weaknesses  O
in  O
South  O
Korea  O
's  O
development  O
model  O
including  O
high  O
debt  O
/  O
equity  O
ratios  O
and  O
massive  O
short-term  O
foreign  O
borrowing  O
.  O
GDP  O
plunged  O
by  O
6.9  O
%  O
in  O
1998  O
,  O
and  O
then  O
recovered  O
by  O
9  O
%  O
in  O
1999  O
-  O
2000  O
.  O
Korea  O
adopted  O
numerous  O
economic  O
reforms  O
following  O
the  O
crisis  O
,  O
including  O
greater  O
openness  O
to  O
foreign  O
investment  O
and  O
imports  O
.  O
Growth  O
moderated  O
to  O
about  O
4  O
-  O
5  O
%  O
annually  O
between  O
2003  O
and  O
2007  O

With  O
the  O
global  O
economic  O
downturn  O
in  O
late  O
2008  O
,  O
South  O
Korean  O
GDP  O
growth  O
slowed  O
to  O
0.2  O

2009  O
.  O
In  O
the  O
third  O
quarter  O
of  O
2009  O
,  O
the  O
economy  O
began  O
to  O
recover  O
,  O
in  O
large  O
part  O
due  O
to  O
export  O
growth  O
,  O
low  O
interest  O
rates  O
,  O
and  O
an  O
expansionary  O
fiscal  O
policy  O

exceeded  O
6  O

in  O
2010  O
.  O
The  O
South  O
Korean  O
economy  O
's  O
long  O
term  O
challenges  O
include  O
a  O
rapidly  O
aging  O
population  O
,  O
inflexible  O
labor  O

and  O
overdependence  O
on  O

Officials  O
in  O
Afghanistan  O
say  O
Taleban  O
,  O
al-Qaida  O
and  O
hundreds  O
of  O
other  O
inmates  O
at  O
a  O
high-security  O
prison  O
in  O
Kabul  O
have  O
taken  O

.  O
Prison  O
officials  O
say  O
the  O
riot  O
erupted  O
Saturday  O
night  O
after  O
a  O
group  O
of  O
prisoners  O
refused  O
to  O
wear  O
new  O
prison  O
uniforms  O
intended  O
to  O
prevent  O
inmates  O
from  O
mingling  O
with  O
visitors  O
and  O
possibly  O
escaping  O
.  O
Seven  O
Taleban  O
inmates  O
used  O
such  O
a  O
method  O
to  O
escape  O
last  O
month  O
.  O
Officials  O
say  O
at  O

1,300  O

in  O
the  O

.  O
Shots  O
were  O

at  O
the  O
Pul-e-Charkhi  O

early  O
Sunday  O

Authorities  O
say  O
no  O
guards  O
were  O
hurt  O
,  O
but  O
several  O
prisoners  O
were  O
injured  O
.  O
Pul-e-Charkhi  O
prison  O
is  O
a  O
huge  O
facility  O
built  O
in  O
the  O
1970s  O
where  O
thousands  O
of  O
Afghans  O
opposing  O
communist  O
rule  O
in  O
the  O
1980s  O
were  O
tortured  O
and  O
killed  O
.  O
The  O
prison  O
now  O
holds  O
common  O
criminals  O
as  O
well  O
as  O
al-Qaida  O
and  O
Taleban-linked  O
militants  O
.  O
Witnesses  O
in  O
Somalia  O

has  O
killed  O
at  O

seven  O
people  O
and  O
injured  O
12  O
others  O
.  O
Residents  O
say  O
Wednesday  O
's  O
fighting  O
began  O
when  O
an  O
African  O
Union  O
plane  O
landed  O
at  O
Mogadishu  O
's  O
main  O
airport  O
in  O
defiance  O
of  O
a  O
ban  O
by  O
the  O
Islamist  O
militant  O
group  O
al-Shabab  O
.  O
The  O
insurgents  O
fired  O
mortars  O
at  O
the  O
airport  O
,  O
triggering  O
a  O
counter-attack  O
.  O
It  O
is  O
not  O
clear  O
whether  O
those  O
shells  O
came  O
from  O
African  O
Union  O
peacekeepers  O
,  O
Ethiopian  O
troops  O
,  O
or  O
Somali  O
government  O
forces  O
.  O
Al-Shabab  O
warned  O
last  O
month  O
that  O
it  O
would  O
attack  O
any  O
planes  O
landing  O
or  O
taking  O
off  O
from  O
the  O

The  O
group  O
said  O
the  O
flights  O
benefit  O
Ethiopia  O
,  O
which  O
has  O
thousands  O
of  O
troops  O
in  O
Somalia  O
backing  O
the  O
interim  O
government  O

The  O
Somali  O
government  O
has  O
urged  O
airlines  O
to  O
use  O
the  O
airport  O
despite  O
the  O
threat  O

On  O
at  O

two  O

It  O
is  O
unclear  O

reverse  O
their  O

,  O
U.S.  O

According  O
to  O
the  O
cables  O
,  O
Saudi  O
Foreign  O
Minister  O
Saud  O
al-Faisal  O
said  O
in  O
May  O
2008  O
that  O
what  O
he  O
called  O
a  O
"  O
security  O
response  O
"  O
was  O
needed  O
to  O
prevent  O
the  O
militant  O
group  O
-  O
and  O
its  O
patron  O
,  O
Iran  O
-  O
from  O
taking  O
power  O
in  O
the  O
Lebanese  O
capital  O

Beirut  O
.  O
The  O
exchange  O
between  O
al-Faisal  O
and  O
U.S.  O
diplomat  O
David  O
Satterfield  O
took  O
place  O
days  O
after  O
Hezbollah  O
had  O
briefly  O
seized  O
control  O
of  O
large  O
sections  O
of  O
Beruit  O
during  O
fighting  O
with  O
pro-government  O
supporters  O
.  O
Al-Faisal  O
told  O
Satterfield  O
that  O
only  O
the  O
Lebanese  O
prime  O
minister  O
,  O
Jordan  O
,  O
Egypt  O
and  O
the  O
Arab  O
League  O
were  O
aware  O
of  O
the  O
plan  O
.  O
The  O
U.S.  O
responded  O
by  O
questioning  O
the  O
political  O
and  O
military  O
feasibility  O
of  O
the  O
plan  O
.  O
The  O
U.S.  O
space  O
agency  O

gather  O
soil  O
samples  O
near  O
the  O
arctic  O
surface  O

Scientists  O
say  O

is  O
interesting  O
because  O
if  O
there  O
is  O
any  O
life  O
on  O
Mars  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
most  O
likely  O
to  O
be  O

the  O

being  O

to  O

The  O
proposed  O
bill  O

imprisonment  O
for  O
denying  O
that  O

victims  O
of  O
genocide  O
during  O
World  O
War  O

adopted  O

the  O
bill  O

that  O
the  O

of  O
one  O

half  O
million  O

There  O
is  O
also  O
concern  O
the  O
storm  O
has  O
the  O
potential  O
to  O
damage  O
a  O
bumper  O
rice  O
crop  O

is  O
denying  O

Farmers  O
in  O

have  O
been  O
in  O
the  O
fields  O
harvesting  O
the  O
crop  O

Completing  O
the  O
harvest  O
could  O
take  O
another  O
two  O
weeks  O

still  O
recovering  O

two  O

his  O
country  O
is  O
moving  O
toward  O
a  O
more  O
flexible  O
foreign  O
exchange  O
rate  O
,  O

that  O
it  O
will  O
be  O
done  O
gradually  O

a  O
meeting  O
with  O
European  O
Union  O
officials  O
in  O
The  O

He  O
said  O
China  O
plans  O
to  O
move  O
away  O
from  O
its  O
current  O
system  O
,  O
which  O
pegs  O
the  O
Chinese  O
yuan  O
to  O
the  O
U.S.  O
dollar  O
,  O
and  O
toward  O
a  O
free-floating  O
exchange  O
.  O
But  O
he  O
said  O
China  O
will  O
make  O
the  O
change  O
on  O
its  O
own  O
timetable  O
,  O
to  O
preserve  O
the  O
nation  O

have  O
pressed  O
China  O
to  O
end  O
its  O
fixed  O
rate  O
,  O
saying  O
it  O
keeps  O
the  O
yuan  O
's  O
value  O
unfairly  O
low  O
,  O
making  O
Chinese  O
goods  O
cheaper  O

It  O
occurred  O
late  O
Monday  O

She  O
says  O
the  O

stole  O

It  O
is  O
unclear  O
whether  O
the  O
attackers  O
belonged  O
to  O
any  O
of  O
the  O
rebel  O
groups  O

government-backed  O

rebel  O
groups  O
.  O
Some  O
rebels  O
have  O
refused  O
to  O
sign  O
the  O
accord  O

It  O
is  O

end  O
more  O

three  O
years  O

A  O
new  O
report  O
from  O
the  O
International  O

urges  O

in  O
Latin  O

to  O
help  O
the  O

cope  O

Friday  O
's  O
IMF  O
report  O
also  O
says  O
the  O

has  O
been  O
helped  O
by  O
a  O
boom  O
in  O
prices  O
for  O
the  O
commodities  O

helping  O
these  O

a  O
key  O

But  O
the  O

also  O
predicts  O
that  O

that  O

by  O
two  O
percent  O

to  O
just  O
3.6  O
percent  O
in  O
2009  O
.  O
The  O
slowing  O

may  O
help  O

says  O
that  O
64  O

of  O
the  O
ban  O
on  O

said  O
that  O

no  O
confidence  O
in  O
the  O

its  O
ability  O

the  O
immediate  O
aftermath  O

announced  O
earlier  O

be  O
allowed  O
at  O
a  O
bombing  O
site  O
for  O
one  O
hour  O
following  O
an  O
attack  O
.  O
Reasons  O
given  O
for  O
the  O
ban  O
include  O
protecting  O
reporters  O
from  O
secondary  O
attacks  O
and  O
preserving  O
evidence  O
from  O

to  O
Protect  O
Journalists  O
,  O
Joel  PERSON
Simon  PERSON
,  O
says  O
the  O
restriction  O
appears  O
to  O
be  O
an  O
attempt  O
to  O
limit  O
media  O
coverage  O
of  O
unwelcome  O
news  O
.  O
In  O
a  O
letter  O
to  O
Iraqi  O
Prime  O
Minister  O
Nouri  O

Simon  O
says  O
there  O
is  O
no  O
justification  O
for  O
news  O
coverage  O
to  O
be  O
obstructed  O
.  O
He  O
called  O
on  O
the  O
prime  O
minister  O
to  O
allow  O
the  O
press  O
to  O
carry  O
out  O
its  O
reporting  O
without  O

Whaling  O
Commission  O

Alaska  O
to  O
decide  O
whether  O
to  O
drop  O
a  O
moratorium  O
on  O
commercial  O
whale  O
hunting  O
.  O
The  O
ban  O
was  O
enacted  O
in  O
1986  O
to  O
help  O
prevent  O
several  O
species  O
of  O
great  O
whales  O
from  O
becoming  O
extinct  O
.  O
Representatives  O
from  O

debate  O
the  O

ends  O
Thursday  O
.  O
Pro-whaling  O
nations  O
such  O
as  O
Japan  O
,  O
Norway  O
and  O
Iceland  O
argue  O
that  O
the  O
ban  O
can  O
be  O
lifted  O
since  O
whale  O
populations  O
have  O
recovered  O
.  O
Approval  O
from  O
56  O
member  O
nations  O
would  O
be  O
needed  O
to  O
overturn  O
the  O
ban  O
.  O
Last  O
year  O
,  O
IWC  O
members  O
voted  O
31-30  O
against  O
a  O
similar  O
motion  O
to  O
repeal  O
the  O
ban  O
.  O
Norway  O
and  O
Iceland  O
are  O
currently  O
the  O
only  O
member  O
nations  O
to  O
openly  O
ignore  O
the  O
moratorium  O
.  O
Japan  O
,  O
which  O
kills  O
about  O
1,000  O

hunts  O
the  O
animals  O
strictly  O
for  O
scientific  O
purposes  O
,  O

funds  O
to  O
buy  O
a  O

bidding  O
regulations  O
when  O
he  O
purchased  O
a  O
Russian  O
helicopter  O
for  O

the  O
Afghan  O
National  O
Army  O

also  O
captured  O
9  O

Janan  O
,  O
in  O

near  O

and  O
six  O

were  O
arrested  O
in  O
another  O

Meanwhile  O
,  O
in  O
the  O
Souray  O
district  O
of  O
neighboring  O
Zabul  O
province  O
,  O
one  O
suspected  O
Taleban  O
rebel  O
was  O
killed  O
and  O
one  O
was  O
wounded  O
by  O
a  O

were  O
planting  O
on  O
a  O

used  O
by  O
Afghan  O

Violence  O
has  O
surged  O
ahead  O
of  O
next  O
month  O
's  O
parliamentary  O
elections  O
in  O
Afghanistan  O
.  O
The  O
U.S.  O
dollar  O
hit  O
record  O
lows  O
against  O
the  O
euro  O
Tuesday  O
.  O
It  O
took  O
more  O
than  O
one  O
dollar  O
and  O
48  O
cents  O
to  O
buy  O
one  O
euro  O
.  O
The  O
dollar  O
has  O
been  O
battered  O
by  O
a  O
series  O
of  O
problems  O
,  O
including  O
continuing  O
gloom  O
in  O
the  O
key  O
U.S.  O
housing  O
sector  O
,  O
and  O
the  O
slowing  O
U.S.  O
economy  O
.  O
Some  O
speculators  O
are  O
selling  O
dollars  O
because  O
they  O
expect  O
the  O
U.S.  O
central  O
bank  O
will  O
try  O
to  O
stimulate  O
the  O
economy  O
by  O
cutting  O
interest  O
rates  O
again  O
soon  O
.  O
Lower  O
U.S.  O
interest  O
rates  O
can  O
cut  O
the  O
return  O
on  O
some  O
investments  O
.  O
The  O
falling  O
dollar  O
is  O
prompting  O
some  O
oil-rich  O
nations  O
around  O
the  O
Persian  O
Gulf  O
to  O
consider  O
ending  O
the  O
practice  O
of  O
linking  O
the  O
value  O
of  O
their  O
currencies  O
to  O
that  O
of  O
the  O
dollar  O
and  O
instead  O
peg  O
the  O
value  O
to  O
a  O
"  O
basket  O
"  O
of  O
other  O
currencies  O
.  O
Such  O
a  O
move  O
would  O
reduce  O
demand  O
for  O
dollars  O
,  O
and  O
further  O
weaken  O
the  O
U.S.  O
currency  O
.  O
Afghan  O

Pakistan  O
's  O
government  O
says  O
the  O
new  O
tribal  O

vindicates  O
its  O
strategy  O
of  O
relying  O
on  O
tribesmen  O
to  O
combat  O
foreign  O
militants  O

areas  O
.  O
FAO  O
Director-General  O
Jacques  O
Diouf  O
told  O
an  O
audience  O
in  O
India  O
Tuesday  O
that  O
crop  O
yields  O
will  O
probably  O
fall  O
in  O
the  O
seasonally  O
dry  O
tropics  O
as  O
global  O
average  O
temperatures  O
rise  O
.  O
He  O
said  O
agriculture  O
dependent  O
on  O
rain  O
in  O
semi-arid  O
regions  O
is  O
particularly  O
at  O
risk  O
.  O
He  O
also  O
said  O
India  O
might  O
lose  O
nearly  O
one-fifth  O
of  O
its  O
rain-fed  O
cereal  O
production  O
.  O
Diouf  O
said  O
small  O
temperature  O
increases  O
of  O
one  O
to  O
three  O
degrees  O
Celsius  O
could  O
boost  O
crop  O
yields  O
in  O
most  O
industrialized  O
countries  O
,  O
which  O
mostly  O
have  O
colder  O
climates  O
,  O
but  O
that  O
higher  O
temperatures  O
would  O
hurt  O
food  O
production  O
at  O
lower  O
altitudes  O
.  O
Diouf  O
called  O
for  O
a  O
concentrated  O
scientific  O
effort  O
to  O
help  O
adapt  O
crops  O
to  O
the  O
likely  O
future  O
conditions  O
.  O
As  O
an  O
example  O
,  O
he  O
cited  O
genetically  O
modifying  O

to  O
be  O

A  O

a  O

that  O

her  O
an  O
egg  O
every  O

She  O

obtain  O
two  O
eggs  O
daily  O

of  O
one  O
,  O

at  O

,  O
to  O
gain  O
her  O

the  O
Hen  O
a  O
double  O
allowance  O

From  O
that  O

never  O

another  O

the  O
private  O
accounts  O

And  O
he  O

the  O

policies  O

initiated  O
in  O

In  O

the  O
government  O
restructured  O
nearly  O
all  O
of  O
its  O
public  O

A  O
CAT  O
fell  O
in  O
love  O
with  O
a  O
handsome  O
young  O
man  O
,  O
and  O
entreated  O
Venus  O
to  O
change  O
her  O
into  O
the  O
form  O
of  O
a  O
woman  O
.  O
Venus  O
consented  O
to  O
her  O
request  O
and  O
transformed  O
her  O
into  O
a  O
beautiful  O
damsel  O
,  O
so  O
that  O
the  O
youth  O
saw  O
her  O
and  O
loved  O
her  O
,  O
and  O
took  O
her  O
home  O
as  O
his  O
bride  O
.  O
While  O
the  O
two  O
were  O
reclining  O
in  O
their  O
chamber  O
,  O
Venus  O
wishing  O
to  O
discover  O
if  O
the  O
Cat  O
in  O
her  O
change  O
of  O
shape  O
had  O
also  O
altered  O
her  O
habits  O
of  O
life  O
,  O
let  O
down  O
a  O
mouse  O
in  O
the  O
middle  O
of  O
the  O
room  O
.  O
The  O
Cat  O
,  O
quite  O
forgetting  O
her  O
present  O
condition  O
,  O
started  O
up  O
from  O
the  O
couch  O
and  O
pursued  O
the  O
mouse  O
,  O
wishing  O
to  O
eat  O
it  O
.  O
Venus  O
was  O
much  O
disappointed  O
and  O
again  O
caused  O
her  O
to  O
return  O
to  O
her  O
former  O
shape  O
.  O
Nature  O
exceeds  O
nurture  O
.  O
A  O
Hart  O
hotly  O
pursued  O
by  O
the  O
hounds  O
fled  O
for  O
refuge  O
into  O
an  O
ox-stall  O
,  O
and  O
buried  O
itself  O
in  O
a  O
truss  O
of  O
hay  O
,  O
leaving  O
nothing  O
to  O
be  O
seen  O
but  O
the  O
tips  O
of  O
his  O
horns  O
.  O
Soon  O
after  O
the  O
Hunters  O
came  O
up  O
and  O
asked  O
if  O
any  O
one  O
had  O
seen  O
the  O
Hart  O
.  O
The  O
stable  O
boys  O
,  O
who  O
had  O
been  O
resting  O
after  O
their  O
dinner  O
,  O
looked  O
round  O
,  O
but  O
could  O
see  O
nothing  O
,  O
and  O
the  O
Hunters  O
went  O
away  O
.  O
Shortly  O
afterwards  O
the  O
master  O
came  O
in  O
,  O
and  O
looking  O
round  O
,  O
saw  O
that  O
something  O
unusual  O
had  O
taken  O
place  O
.  O
He  O
pointed  O
to  O
the  O
truss  O
of  O
hay  O
and  O
said  O
:  O
"  O
What  O
are  O
those  O
two  O
curious  O
things  O
sticking  O
out  O
of  O
the  O
hay  O
?  O
"  O
And  O
when  O
the  O
stable  O
boys  O
came  O
to  O
look  O
they  O
discovered  O
the  O
Hart  O
,  O
and  O
soon  O
made  O
an  O
end  O
of  O
him  O
.  O
He  O
thus  O
learnt  O
that  O
Nothing  O
escapes  O
the  O
master  O
's  O
eye  O
.  O
The  O
people  O
who  O
say  O
they  O

rather  O
push  O
a  O
Ford  O
than  O
drive  O
a  O
Chevy  O

do  O
.  O
U.S.  O

say  O

is  O
willing  O
to  O
send  O
hundreds  O

's  O
decision  O
,  O
calling  O
it  O

But  O
he  O

called  O
on  O
Beijing  O

to  O
agree  O
to  O
the  O

said  O
increased  O

to  O
Africa  O
must  O
be  O
tied  O
to  O
good  O
governance  O
and  O
efforts  O
to  O

Increasing  O
numbers  O

Increasing  O
numbers  O

too  O
-  O
signaling  O
that  O
the  O
household  O
will  O
not  O
welcome  O
trick-or-treaters  O

because  O
the  O

are  O
annoyed  O
by  O

costumes  O
who  O
continue  O
to  O
come  O
knocking  O
,  O
well  O
into  O
their  O
teens  O
.  O
And  O
in  O
a  O
tight  O
economy  O
,  O
some  O
residents  O
no  O
longer  O
want  O
to  O
go  O
to  O

many  O
held  O
for  O
years  O
without  O
trial  O
.  O
The  O
facility  O
has  O
been  O
widely  O
criticized  O
by  O
human  O
rights  O
groups  O
.  O
President  O
Barack  O
Obama  O
ordered  O
the  O
facility  O
to  O
be  O
shut  O
down  O
within  O
a  O
year  O
after  O
he  O
took  O
office  O
in  O
January  O
2009  O
.  O
However  O
,  O
the  O
deadline  O
passed  O
amid  O
difficulty  O
in  O
finding  O
places  O
to  O
put  O
the  O
detainees  O
.  O
More  O
than  O
40  O
other  O
countries  O
have  O
accepted  O
at  O

one  O
prisoner  O
.  O
The  O
U.S.  O
says  O
178  O

Zambia  O
's  O
economy  O
has  O
experienced  O
strong  O
growth  O
in  O
recent  O
years  O
,  O
with  O
real  O
GDP  O
growth  O
in  O
2005  O
-  O
10  O
about  O
6  O
%  O
per  O
year  O
.  O
Privatization  O
of  O
government-owned  O
copper  O
mines  O
in  O
the  O
1990s  O
relieved  O
the  O
government  O
from  O
covering  O
mammoth  O
losses  O
generated  O
by  O
the  O
industry  O
and  O
greatly  O
increased  O
copper  O
mining  O
output  O
and  O
profitability  O
to  O
spur  O
economic  O
growth  O
.  O
Copper  O
output  O
has  O
increased  O
steadily  O
since  O
2004  O
,  O
due  O
to  O
higher  O
copper  O
prices  O
and  O
foreign  O
investment  O
.  O
In  O
2005  O
,  O
Zambia  O
qualified  O
for  O

relief  O
under  O
the  O

Country  O
Initiative  O
,  O
consisting  O
of  O
approximately  O
USD  O
6  O
billion  O
in  O
debt  O
relief  O
.  O
Poverty  O
remains  O
a  O
significant  O
problem  O
in  O
Zambia  O
,  O
despite  O
a  O
stronger  O
economy  O
.  O
Zambia  O
's  O
dependency  O
on  O
copper  O
makes  O
it  O
vulnerable  O
to  O
depressed  O
commodity  O
prices  O
,  O
but  O
record  O
high  O
copper  O
prices  O
and  O
a  O
bumper  O
maize  O
crop  O
in  O
2010  O
helped  O
Zambia  O
rebound  O
quickly  O
from  O
the  O
world  O
economic  O
slowdown  O
that  O
began  O
in  O
2008  O
.  O
A  O
high  O
birth  O

relatively  O
high  O
HIV  O
/  O
AIDS  O
burden  O
,  O
and  O
market  O
distorting  O
agricultural  O
policies  O
have  O
meant  O
that  O
Zambia  O
's  O
economic  O
growth  O
has  O
not  O
dramatically  O
decreased  O
the  O
stubbornly  O
high  O
poverty  O
rates  O
.  O
Slovakia  O
's  O
roots  O
can  O
be  O
traced  O
to  O
the  O
9th  O
century  O
state  O
of  O
Great  O
Moravia  O
.  O
Subsequently  O
,  O
the  O
Slovaks  O

they  O

the  O
next  O
1,000  O

language  O
and  O
education  O
policies  O
favoring  O
the  O
use  O
of  O
Hungarian  O
(  O
Magyarization  O

resulted  O
in  O
a  O
strengthening  O
of  O

Following  O

Czechoslovakia  O
became  O
a  O

Soviet  O
influence  O
collapsed  O
in  O

She  O
called  O
all  O
the  O
girls  O
to  O
the  O
bathroom  O
and  O
met  O
them  O
there  O
with  O
the  O
maintenance  O
man  O
.  O
She  O
explained  O
that  O
all  O
these  O
lip  O
prints  O
were  O
causing  O
a  O
major  O
problem  O
for  O
the  O
custodian  O
who  O
had  O
to  O
clean  O
the  O
mirrors  O
every  O
night  O
.  O
To  O
demonstrate  O
how  O
difficult  O
it  O
had  O
been  O
to  O
clean  O
the  O
mirrors  O
,  O
she  O
asked  O
the  O
maintenance  O
man  O
to  O
show  O
the  O
girls  O
how  O
much  O
effort  O
was  O
required  O
.  O
He  O
took  O
out  O
a  O
long-handled  O
squeegee  O
,  O
dipped  O
it  O
in  O
the  O
toilet  O
,  O
and  O
cleaned  O
the  O
mirror  O
with  O
it  O
.  O
Since  O
then  O
,  O
there  O
have  O
been  O
no  O
lip  O
prints  O
on  O
the  O
mirror  O
.  O
There  O
are  O
teachers  O
,  O
and  O
then  O
there  O
are  O
educators  O
...  O
I  O
am  O
not  O
a  O
believer  O
in  O
s�ances  O
,  O
but  O
I  O
went  O
to  O
one  O
just  O
to  O
see  O
what  O
they  O
are  O
like  O
.  O
The  O
psychic  O
was  O
doing  O
his  O
thing  O
and  O
grinning  O
from  O
ear  O
to  O
ear  O
.  O
I  O
assumed  O
his  O
merriment  O
was  O
due  O
to  O
the  O
fact  O
that  O
he  O
was  O
fooling  O
a  O
gullible  O
public  O
and  O
gave  O
him  O
a  O
poke  O
in  O
the  O
nose  O
.  O
You  O
can  O
probably  O
guess  O
the  O
rest  O
...  O
I  O
was  O
arrested  O
for  O
striking  O
a  O
happy  O
medium  O
...  O
Ethiopia  O
Saturday  O

comes  O
after  O

pardoned  O
another  O
38  O
opposition  O

That  O

None  O

been  O
charged  O
in  O

with  O
any  O
crimes  O
.  O
All  O
had  O
been  O
rounded  O
up  O
